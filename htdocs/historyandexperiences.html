            <h2 class="title">How I got into anime?</h2>
            <p class="history"> 
                I started watching anime back in the year 2014. My friend introduced me to anime when we watched a show together. We watched an anime called "Love, Chuunibyo & Other Delusions!". 
                It was my first anime, and it was funny, interesting, and romantic. After that, I started watching more animes such as "Hyouka", "K-On", "Golden Time", and many more. At this point, 
                I got hooked to watching anime and reading manga. Nowadays, I love watching romance, isekai, and psychological animes.

            <h2 class="experience">My Overall Experience in Anime</h2>
            <p class="overallexperience">
                Overall, my experience in watching anime is very enjoyable and definitely one of the best parts of my life. There were some animes that made me feel happy, some that made me feel sad, 
                some that made me laugh, some that made me feel emotions that I did not even know I could feel. This is proof enough that anime, like all other forms of media, is quite entertaining and 
                is able to sway its viewers’ emotions as it sees fit. Basically, anime is an incredibly diverse form of media that has entertained me for quite a while now. As I have stated before, I have 
                been watching and enjoying anime since 2014, that speaks volumes on how it truly is a form of media that’s diverse since I haven’t gotten bored of it despite watching for over 7 years now. 
                It helps me relax from stress, and just entertains me whenever I’m sitting idly. I’ve even learned a lot of life lessons from watching various animes over the years. I gained more friends
                due to the fact that we have the same interest, anime.
