                "Gigguk, is a Thai-British YouTuber and podcaster who is known for his comedic rants and reviews on anime and otaku culture. He 
                is affiliated with the Kadokawa-backed agency GeeXPlus" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigguk">Wikipedia</a>. I love watching his hilarious 
                and relatable content on Youtube. He has done numerous collaborations with other youtubers/streamers that I love to watch such as Mori Calliope, Lilypichu, 
                The Anime Man, CDavgVA, and a couple more.

                and gaming. He is also known for his interviews with people in the Japanese entertainment industry, such as light novel authors, manga artists, and voice 
                actors in anime" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anime_Man">Wikipedia</a>. I love watching his videos because, like Gigguk, his videos are interesting 
                and very entertaining. He collabs with people from different industries which makes his content diverse and not at all repetitive.

                Him, along with Gigguk and The Anime Man, created Trash Taste, a weekly podcast where they talk about various topics, play games, or have specials, wherein they do challenges. 
                His favorite anime is JoJo's Bizarre Adventure which is a fact that he has been known for in his community. His content is very funny, interesting, and diverse which causes me and 
                millions of other people to laugh hysterically whenever watching his content.

                with each other. Her videos are neat, enjoyable, and interesting. Her collaborations are very funny and I enjoy watching her videos.
